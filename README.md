CRET - Can Bus Reverse Engineering Toolkit

Author: Adrian Marcos Batlle
Tutors: Álvar Arnaiz Gonzalez and César Represa Pérez

# Why another CAN tool?

- Built from scratch with new ideas for analysis mechanisms.
- The unique tool with easy identification and tagging of the packets.
- Comfortable analysis using a GUI.
- Internal project management with SQLite database.
- RAW Sniffing.
- Real-time graphical sniffing.
- Posibility to configure to ignore unuseful packets when sniffing.
- Posibility to split byte values to help identification of the data.
- JSON import and export for identified packets.

# Setup and running:

- Just run .jar file. Custom hardware is needed. You can find gerber files in hardware folder to DIY.

# Features

- 2-Interface support at the same time.
- RAW sniffing on trace mode (shows all packet changes).
- RAW sniffing on monitor mode (updates all packet changes).
- Real-time graphical sniffing.
- Remove option to hide unuseful plotted packets.
- Internal project management with SQLite database.
- Dashboard with identified packets.
- Posibility to import and export JSON files with the identified packets.
- Posibility to ignore unuseful packets (packets with value 00).
- Posibility to split bytes to help identification of the data.
- Threaded sniffing and GUI.
- Clean tabs option for each analysis.
- Comfortable and intuitive GUI.
