CRET - Can Bus Reverse Engineering Toolkit

#Why another CAN tool?

*Built from scratch with new ideas for analysis mechanisms.
*The unique tool with easy identification and tagging of the packets.
*Comfortable analysis using a GUI.
*Internal project management qith SQLite database.
*RAW Sniffing.
*Real-time graphical Sniffing
*Posibility to configure to ignore unusefull packets when sniffing.
*Posibility to split byte values to help identification of the data.
*JSON import and export for identified packets.

#Setup and running:

*Just run .jar file. Custom hardware is needed. You can find gerber files in hardware folder to DIY.

#Features

*2-Interface support at the same time.
*RAW Sniffing.
*Internal proyect management with SQLite database.
*Real-time graphical sniffing.
*Dashboard with identified packets.
*Posibility to import and export JSON files with the identified packets.
*Posibility to ignore unuseful packets (packets with value 00).
*Posibility to split bytes to help identification of the data.
*Threaded sniffing and GUI.
*Clean tabs for each analysis.
